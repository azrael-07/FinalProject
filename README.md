Designed and implemented a comprehensive predictive maintenance system to forecast machine and aircraft component failures, achieving a 99.62% accuracy rate. Utilized XGBoost for advanced modeling and integrated SHAP analysis to enhance model transparency and interpretability. Incorporated a 21-day prediction horizon to enable early detection of potential failures, minimizing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules. Developed features from telemetry data, maintenance logs, and error codes while ensuring data quality through preprocessing techniques. Delivered actionable insights with SHAP feature importance plots and individual force plots to support data-driven decision-making.
